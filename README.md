# [Calorie Tracker](https://calorie-tracker-0245c5ccb0dc.herokuapp.com/)

Calorie Tacker was developed to make it simple and effective for users to manage their daily caloric intake. Calorie tracker is able to modify the calorie goal, add and remove entries, and search through a food library kept on Google Sheets. Based on the total calories of entries and the predetermined calorie goal, the remaining daily calories are calculated and displayed.

## User Experience (UX)
### User Goals
To help people reach their objectives more easily, the users' primary objective is to record and keep track of food items and their calorie counts. 
- The user must have the option to create new calorie goals or target.
- Since every user has a distinct dietary requirements, add custom entries to the tracker.
- To facilitate access in the future, save customized entries to a library.
- Remove items if the daily diet plan has altered or if entries are inaccurate.
- See how many calories they still have (calorie goal - total of all entries).


### User Journey
1. Welcome Screen
    - Provides a brief introduction to the application and its functions.

    - Current date is displayed above the tracker table.
    - The table gives information on the things that are presently being tracked; if there are no entries, feedback will take the place of the table section.
    - Below the table, you can see the Calorie Goal and Remaining Calorie Total.
    - Menu items give precise instructions on how to continue.

3. Update Calorie Goal
    - User is able to set a new calorie goal.
    - The user's input is verified to make sure that only numbers are submitted and that the target calorie range of 1500â€“3500 is reasonable.
    - The user will return to the main tracker after the calorie goal has been validated and updated in the calorie tracker.

4. Manually Add Food Items
    - Enables the user to build a custom entry in Tracker and store it in a library for convenient access to entries in the future.
    - The following steps must be followed in order to create a new entry:
        1. Decide on the meal schedule (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack).
        2. Give the item a name and some background information.
        3. Type in the item's calories per 100g.
        4. The user will enter the item's needed serving size.
    - After the entry is previewed, you can choose to add it to the tracker, save it to the food library, or exit to main tracker.

5. Search & Add From Library
    - Allows the user to search for existing food items in the Google sheet and add food items to the tracker.
    - The following steps must be followed in order to search and add an entry:
        1. Type the item's name into the search field.
        2. If the item is found, the user has to choose it from a list by referring to the item number column.
        3. The chosen item will be shown for verification, with options to add it to the tracker or go back to the search.
        4. The user will choose their meal schedule (breakfast, lunch, supper, and snack) if they choose to add an item.
        5. The user will enter the item's needed serving size.
        6. The entry will be added to the tracker and the user will return to the Calorie Tracker

### Design
Since this is a terminal application, the interface contrast was created solely by simple text alteration and styling. Moreover, table formatting to show information in a structured table.

#### Colors
In order to create contrast and organize the information hierarchy, [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) was utilized to bring color to the terminal text. 
- Error messages were colored red to make error identification easier.
- Blue was used for the logo and primary elements.
- Green was used for confirmation elements and Current Calorie Goal text.
- Yellow was used for Remaining Calorie Text
- DIM was used to display information without taking focus off the main request

#### Fonts
In order to provide information hierarchy in text [Fontstyle](https://pypi.org/project/fontstyle/) with assistance from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fontstyle-module-in-python/)
- Italic was used for information text and examples


#### Wireframe / Sketches
- This sketch was created prior to finalizing page content.

## Deployment
The program was developed using GitPod, which was then committed and pushed to GitHub using the GitPod terminal. The finished project was deployed in Heroku using the Code Institute Python Terminal for display purposes.

### Connecting Google Sheets
- This project required the use of Google Drive API and Google Sheets API, both enabled via Google Cloud Platform.
- A credentials file was generated through the Google Drive API and added to the workspace.
- To ensure that the sensitive information contained in the credentials would not be pushed to the repository, the credentials file was added to gitignore.
- The client_email address contained within the credentials file was added to Google Sheets as an editor to enable access.
- Variables and scope to access the worksheet were defined at the top of the run.py file.
- Using the terminal, GSpread and OAuth packages were installed.

### Heroku
Deployment to Heroku was completed using the following steps:

1. Update your requirements.txt file
    - Run pip3 freeze > requirements.txt' in the terminal to add a list of dependencies to requirements.txt.
    - Commit and push the changes to Github.
2. Log in to Heroku and from the dashboard, click Create New App.
    - Enter an app name and choose your region. Click Create App.
3. Go to Settings and update the ConfigVars.
    - Click Reveal ConfigVars and add the following information:
        - KEY = 'CREDS', VALUE = Copy and paste the entire contents of the creds.json file into this field.
        - KEY = 'PORT', VALUE = '8000'.
    - Click Add after entering each ConfigVar.
4. Within Settings, update the Buildpacks.
    - Click Add Buildpack and add the following buildpacks:
        - Add Python and click Add Buildpack.
        - Add NodeJS and click Add Buildpack.
        - Make sure the Python buildpack is above the NodeJS buildpack.
