# [Calorie Tracker](https://calorie-tracker-0245c5ccb0dc.herokuapp.com/)

Calorie Tacker was developed to make it simple and effective for users to manage their daily caloric intake. Calorie tracker is able to modify the calorie goal, add and remove entries, and search through a food library kept on Google Sheets. Based on the total calories of entries and the predetermined calorie goal, the remaining daily calories are calculated and displayed.

## User Experience (UX)
### User Goals
To help people reach their objectives more easily, the users' primary objective is to record and keep track of food items and their calorie counts. 
- The user must have the option to update the calorie goals to match their calorie target.
- Since every user has a distinct dietary requirements, the ability to add custom entries to the tracker is present.
- To facilitate access to food items in the future, the user is able to save customized entries to the food library.
- Providing a means to remove items if the daily diet plan has altered or if entries are inaccurate.
- Displaying how many calories the user still has before reaching the daily target, provides visual feedback (calorie goal - total of all entries).


### User Journey
1. Welcome Screen
    - Provides a brief introduction to the application and its functions.
    - Displaying key functions and understanding to get the user started on their calorie tracking experience.

2. Calorie Tracker
    - Heading clearly identifies the current page.
    - Current date is displayed above the tracker table along side the table title, Currently Tracked Items.
    - The table provides information on the items that are presently being tracked; if there are no entries, feedback will take the place of the table section.
    - Remaining Calories for the day, are displayed and adapted as entries are added providing the user with visual feedback.
    - Menu items give precise instructions on how to continue.

3. Update Calorie Goal
    - User is able to set a new calorie goal based on their requirements.
    - The user's input is verified to make sure that only numbers are submitted and that the target calorie range of 1500â€“3500 is reasonable.
    - The user will return to the Calorie Tracker after the calorie goal has been validated and updated.

4. Manually Add Food Items
    - This enables the user to build a custom entry in Tracker and store it in a library for convenient access to entries in the future.
    - The following steps must be followed in order to create a new entry:
        1. Decide on the meal schedule (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack).
        2. Give the item a name and some background information.
        3. Enter the item's calories per 100g.
        4. The user will enter the item's needed serving size.
        5. Preview and confirm entry information and choose from displayed options.
            - The user can choose to add the entry to the tracker, save the item to the food library, or exit to main tracker.

5. Search & Add From Library
    - Allows the user to search for existing food items in the Google sheet Food Library and add items to the tracker.
    - The following steps must be followed in order to search and add an entry:
        1. Type the item's name into the search field.
        2. If the item is found, the user has to choose an option from a results table by referring to the item number column.
        3. The chosen item will be shown for verification, with options to add it to the tracker or go back to the search.
        4. The user will choose their meal schedule (breakfast, lunch, supper, and snack) if they choose to add an item.
        5. The user will enter the item's needed serving size.
        6. The entry will be added to the tracker and the user will return to the Calorie Tracker

## Design
Since this is a terminal application, the interface contrast was created solely by simple text alteration and styling using [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/).
Adding data into a table format using [Tabulate](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/) provides a clean and structure approach to displaying information.

### Colors
In order to create contrast and organize the information hierarchy, [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) was utilized to bring color to the terminal text. 
- Error messages are colored red to make error identification easier.
- Blue was used for the logo and primary elements.
- Green was used for confirmation elements and Current Calorie Goal text.
- Yellow was used for Remaining Calorie Text
- DIM was used to display information without taking focus off the main request

### Fonts
In order to provide information hierarchy with text [Fontstyle](https://pypi.org/project/fontstyle/) was used. Assistance from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fontstyle-module-in-python/)
- Italic was used for information text and examples
- Bold was used for main requests and headings
